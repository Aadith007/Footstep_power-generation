Footstep power generation and storing by use of piezo sensors 
The project Power Generating Dancing Mat aims to develop a piezoelectric-based
 power-generating dance mat that converts mechanical energy from dancing movements
 into electrical energy. Man has needed and used energy at an increasing rate for the
 sustenance and well-being since time immemorial. Due to this a lot of energy resources
 have been exhausted and wasted. Proposal for the utilization of waste energy of foot
 power with human locomotion is very much relevant and important for highly populated
 countries like India where the railway station, temples etc., are overcrowded all round
 the clock. When the flooring is engineered with piezo electric technology, the electrical
 energy produced by the pressure is captured by floor sensors and converted to an electrical
 charge by piezo transducers, then stored and used as a power source. And this power
 source has many applications as in agriculture, home application and street lighting and
 as energy source for sensors in remote locations.
